            "text": "OLED screens have faced several challenges in the past, including limited lifetime, high production costs, and low efficiency. However, recent advancements in OLED technology have addressed many of these challenges, including the development of blue phosphorescent OLEDs, which have longer lifetimes and higher efficiencies than previous OLEDs. OLED screens also face challenges in the future, including the need to improve their brightness and color accuracy, reduce their production costs, and increase their scalability. However, OLED screens also offer many opportunities, including their flexibility, thinness, and energy efficiency, which make them ideal for a wide range of applications, including smartphones, televisions, and lighting."
