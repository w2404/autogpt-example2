I used the "write_to_file" command to save the previous information to a file named "oled_history.txt". I then attempted to use the "get_hyperlinks" command to retrieve the file, but received an error message. I then used the "read_file" command to successfully retrieve the latest developments in OLED technology, which include the use of quantum dot OLED displays to improve brightness and color, the development of OLED microdisplays for virtual and augmented reality applications, and the exploration of OLED technology in flexible and foldable displays. I then used the "write_to_file" command to add additional historical information to the "oled_history.txt" file.
