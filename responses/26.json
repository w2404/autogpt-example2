The history dates back to the 1960s, with the first practical OLED devices developed in the 1980s. OLED technology has since evolved with full-color displays, improved efficiency, and longer lifespans. I then used the \"google\" command to search for major milestones in the development of OLED technology. The search returned several results, including an overview of milestones in OLED technology, the three generations of emitter materials, and the potential usage of OLEDs in the lighting and display industry."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
