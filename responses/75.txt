            "text": "OLED screens were first developed in the 1980s by researchers at Eastman Kodak, who discovered that organic materials could be used to create light-emitting diodes. However, it was not until the 1990s that OLED screens began to be used in commercial products, such as digital cameras and cell phones. Since then, OLED screens have continued to evolve and improve, with advancements in materials science and manufacturing processes leading to higher efficiencies, longer lifetimes, and lower production costs."
