OLED technology has been evolving since the 1960s, with the development of full-color displays, improved efficiency, and longer lifespans. I added this information to the \"oled_trends.txt\" file using the \"write_to_file\" command. The latest development shows that OLED diode technology was invented by researchers at the Eastman Kodak company in 1987. OLED devices have come forward based on three generations of emitter materials relying on fluorescence (first generation), phosphorescence (second generation), and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (third generation). Furthermore, research in academia and industry toward the fourth generation of OLEDs is in progress. OLED displays have deeper blacks, better contrast, and a more vivid display."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
