I used the command "google" with the argument "recent advancements in OLED technology" and my computer returned a list of search results. I then used the command "write_to_file" to create a file named "oled_advancements.txt" and wrote a summary of recent advancements in OLED technology, including 3D-printed flexible OLED displays, QD-OLED panels, and the world's brightest OLED microdisplay. The command returned "File written to successfully." I then used the command "append_to_file" to add a history of OLED screens to the same file, including the first OLED display created in 1987 and the world's first rollable OLED television announced by LG in 2021. The command returned "File written to successfully."
