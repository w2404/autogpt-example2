            "text": "Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have come a long way ever since their first introduction in 1987 at Eastman Kodak. Today, OLEDs are especially valued in the display and lighting industry. OLED diode technology was invented by researchers at the Eastman Kodak company in 1987. Chemists Ching W. Tang and Steven Van Slyke were the principal inventors. In June 2001, Van Slyke and Tang received an Industrial Innovation Award from the American Chemical Society for their work with organic light-emitting diodes. Manufacturing of small molecule OLEDs was started in 1997 by Pioneer Corporation, followed by TDK in 2001 and Samsung - NEC Mobile Display (SNMD), which later became one of the world's largest OLED display manufacturers - Samsung Display, in 2002. The Sony XEL-1, released in 2007, was the first OLED television."
