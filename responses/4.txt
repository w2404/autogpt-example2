I used the command "google" to search for the history of OLED screens. The search returned a list of articles and websites that provide information about the history of OLED technology. The articles revealed that OLED technology was first introduced in 1987 at Eastman Kodak, and since then, research and development of OLED technology have continuously evolved in academia as well as in industry. OLED displays have deeper blacks, better contrast, and a more vivid display compared to LCD displays. The first OLED television was released in 2007 by Sony.
