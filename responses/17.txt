            "text": "OLED screens have faced several challenges, including limited lifespan, high production costs, and the need for improved efficiency. OLED screens are also susceptible to burn-in, which can cause permanent damage to the display. However, OLED technology has also presented several opportunities, including the ability to create flexible and transparent displays, as well as the potential for use in automotive lighting and medical devices. OLED technology is still evolving, and research is ongoing to address these challenges and further improve the technology."
