            "text": "Recent advancements in OLED technology:\n- Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have rapidly grown as one of the leading technologies for full-color display panels and eco-friendly lighting sources due to their outstanding features including superior color quality, wide viewing angle, mercury-free manufacture, fascinating flexibility, etc.\n- This review reports the latest advances in the optical design of OLEDs that address the external coupling efficiency of OLEDs. Discussed at first are the fundamentals of OLED optics and how the refractive indices of different layers in an OLED stack affect the extraction efficiency.\n- Ph-OLED is a next-generation most efficient display and lighting device that overcomes the limitation of efficiency (25%) in fluorescence OLED. We can get better internal quantum efficiency due to the participation of both singlet and triplet state transitions.\n- In a groundbreaking new study, researchers at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities used a customized printer to fully 3D print a flexible organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display.\n- QD-OLED panels on both TVs and gaming monitors are made by Samsung Display and differ from those manufactured by LG."
