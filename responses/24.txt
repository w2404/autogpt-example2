I added information on the history of OLED screens to the "oled_challenges.txt" file using the "append_to_file" command. The history dates back to the 1960s, with the first practical OLED devices developed in the 1980s. OLED technology has since evolved with full-color displays, improved efficiency, and longer lifespans. I then used the "google" command to search for major milestones in the development of OLED technology.
