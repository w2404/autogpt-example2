I wrote key information on the challenges and opportunities of OLED screens to a file named "oled_challenges.txt". The challenges include limited lifespan, high production costs, limited brightness and scalability, and limited color gamut. However, OLED screens offer opportunities such as thin and flexible form factors, high contrast ratios, and low power consumption. I also learned historical information on OLED technology, including its development in the 1980s by researchers at Eastman Kodak and its use in a wide range of applications. I appended this information to the "oled_challenges.txt" file.
