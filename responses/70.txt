I used the command "google" with the argument "recent advancements in OLED technology". My computer returned a list of search results, including recent advances in OLED technology such as fully 3D-printed, flexible OLED displays, QD-OLED panels, and the world's brightest OLED microdisplay. Nothing new happened.
