I used the "google" command and received information on recent developments and future trends in OLED technology. The search results included information on the increasing usage of foldable and rollable OLEDs in the generation of new mobile devices, as well as the projected growth of the global OLED market. Experts predict that OLED displays will become commonplace in TVs after conquering the smartphone and tablet scene. Additionally, the search results provided information on the current and future use of OLED technology, including its power efficiency and brighter pictures. 

I wrote the information to a file named "oled_trends.txt" using the "write_to_file" command. I then used the "read_file" command to read from a file named "oled_challenges.txt". The file contained information on the challenges and opportunities of OLED screens, including their limited lifespan, high production costs, susceptibility to burn-in, and potential for use in flexible and transparent displays, automotive lighting, and medical devices. The history of OLED screens dates back to the 1960s, and over the years, OLED technology has continued to evolve with the development of full-color displays, improved efficiency, and longer lifespans.
