            "text": "OLED screens were first developed in the 1960s by researchers at the RCA Corporation, who discovered that organic materials could emit light when an electric current was applied. However, it wasn't until the 1980s that OLED technology began to be developed for practical applications. In 1987, researchers at Eastman Kodak built the first OLED device that operated at sufficiently low voltages, marking a breakthrough in OLED technology. Since then, OLED technology has continued to evolve, with the development of full-color displays, improved efficiency, and longer lifespans. Today, OLED screens are used in a wide range of applications, including smartphones, tablets, TVs, and lighting systems."
