            "text": "Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have come a long way since their first introduction in 1987 at Eastman Kodak. OLED devices have come forward based on three generations of emitter materials relying on fluorescence (first generation), phosphorescence (second generation), and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (third generation). Furthermore, research in academia and industry toward the fourth generation of OLEDs is in progress. OLEDs have been used in a variety of applications, including displays, lighting, and wearable devices. The first OLED television was released in 2007 by Sony. OLED technology has continued to evolve, with advancements in areas such as efficiency, lifespan, and flexibility. In recent years, OLED technology has been used in foldable smartphones and rollable televisions. The future of OLED technology looks promising, with potential applications in areas such as automotive lighting and medical devices."
