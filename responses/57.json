The first OLED display was a monochrome display with a resolution of 64x64 pixels. In the 1990s, researchers at the University of Michigan developed the first full-color OLED display. OLED technology has since been used in a wide range of applications, including smartphones, TVs, and wearable devices.\"\n        }\n    }\n}"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
