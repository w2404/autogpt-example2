I used the "google" command to search for information on the challenges and opportunities of OLED screens. The search returned several articles discussing the challenges of OLED technology, including its limitations in terms of lifetime, cost, and size scalability. One article also mentioned that the major challenge is still with the lifetime of blue phosphorescent OLEDs. However, OLEDs are being used for display, mobile devices, and TV, and the next major application for OLED technology is in AR and VR displays. The reports on OLED display market provide a holistic analysis, market size and forecast, trends, growth drivers, and challenges, as well as vendor analysis covering around 25 vendors. Nothing new happened.
