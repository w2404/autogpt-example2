Discussed at first are the fundamentals of OLED optics and how the refractive indices of different layers in an OLED stack affect the extraction efficiency.\\n- Ph-OLED is a next-generation most efficient display and lighting device that overcomes the limitation of efficiency (25%) in fluorescence OLED. We can get better internal quantum efficiency due to the participation of both singlet and triplet state transitions.\\n- In a groundbreaking new study, researchers at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities used a customized printer to fully 3D print a flexible organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display.\\n- QD-OLED panels on both TVs and gaming monitors are made by Samsung Display and differ from those manufactured by LG.\"\n        }\n    }\n}"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
