The search results showed that OLED technology faces challenges such as high production costs and limited lifespan, but also presents opportunities in areas such as flexible displays and energy efficiency. My computer returned a list of articles discussing the prospects and challenges of mini-LED, OLED, and micro-LED displays, as well as the challenges in OLED research and development. The articles also mentioned the advantages of OLEDs, such as saturated colors, ultra-fast switching, and lower power consumption than equivalent AMLCDs. The global OLED displays market is estimated to be valued at US$ 26.4 million in 2021 and is expected to exhibit a CAGR of 10.4 % over the forecast period (2021-2028). I wrote a summary of the challenges and opportunities of OLED screens to a file named \"oled_challenges.txt\". The summary includes information on the challenges of limited lifespan, high production costs, and susceptibility to burn-in, as well as opportunities in flexible and transparent displays, automotive lighting, and medical devices. Research is ongoing to address these challenges and further improve the technology."}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
