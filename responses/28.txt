I wrote major milestones in the development of OLED technology to a new file called "oled_milestones.txt" using the "write_to_file" command. The milestones date back to the 1960s and include the development of full-color displays and flexible and transparent displays. The command returned a successful file write. I also added information on the challenges and opportunities of OLED screens to the "oled_challenges.txt" file using the "append_to_file" command. Challenges include limited lifespan and susceptibility to water damage, while opportunities include use in flexible and transparent displays, automotive lighting, and medical devices.
