However, it was not until the 1980s that the first practical OLED devices were developed. These early devices were monochromatic and had limited efficiency and lifespan. Over the years, OLED technology has continued to evolve, with the development of full-color displays, improved efficiency, and longer lifespans. Today, OLED screens are used in a wide range of applications, including smartphones, televisions, and wearable devices.\"\n        }\n    }\n}"}, "finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0}]}
