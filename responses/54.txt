I used the "read_file" command to retrieve historical information on OLED technology, which includes the development of OLED displays in the 1980s and the first full-color OLED display in the 1990s. OLED technology has since been used in a wide range of applications, including smartphones, TVs, and wearable devices. Additionally, I used the "google" command to search for information on the challenges and opportunities of OLED screens.
