I used the "google" command to search for the latest developments in OLED technology. Command google returned a list of articles discussing the best OLED TVs of 2023, new TV technologies, and improvements to OLED technology such as QD-OLED and OLED evo. LG has introduced OLED evo technology, a generational improvement over standard OLED technology, and mid-range TVs have benefitted from QNED - a combination of quantum dot and NanoCell technologies. Visionox has released new OLED technologies to consolidate its leading position. Nothing new happened.
