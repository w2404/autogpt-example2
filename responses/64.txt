I previously used the command "google" with the argument "major milestones in the development of OLED technology" and my computer returned a message saying that the text was appended successfully to the "oled_challenges.txt" file. Now, my computer returned a list of search results for my query, including an overview of milestones in OLED technology, the three generations of emitter materials, and the fourth generation of OLEDs in progress. The search also included the history of emitter development and industry's interest in OLED technology, the potential usage of OLEDs in the lighting and display industry, and the major milestone reached in OLED development with a new flexible prototype. I then used the command "read_file" with the argument "filename": "oled_challenges.txt" to read the appended text.
