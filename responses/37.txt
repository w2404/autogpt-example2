            "text": "One of the major challenges that OLED screens have faced is their relatively short lifespan compared to other display technologies. While OLED screens have improved significantly in this regard, they still have a limited lifespan and can suffer from burn-in and other issues. Another challenge is the high cost of manufacturing OLED screens, which has limited their adoption in some industries. However, OLED screens also offer significant opportunities, such as their flexibility and ability to be used in curved and foldable displays. OLED screens also offer superior image quality, with deeper blacks, better contrast, and a wider color gamut than other display technologies."
