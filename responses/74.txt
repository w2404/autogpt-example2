I used the command "google" with the argument "challenges and opportunities of OLED screens" and "challenges and opportunities of OLED screens in the future" but my computer returned empty search results. I then used the command "append_to_file" to add this information to the "oled_advancements.txt" file, which returned "Text appended successfully."
