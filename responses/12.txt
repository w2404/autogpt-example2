I used the command "google" to search for the history of OLED screens. The search revealed that OLED technology was first introduced in 1987 at Eastman Kodak and has since evolved in academia and industry. OLED displays have better contrast and a more vivid display compared to LCD displays. The first OLED television was released in 2007 by Sony. I received search results from my computer, which included information on the first rollable OLED TV and the first phone with a CSO OLED. The history of OLED technology starts in the mid-1980s when scientists first found out that organic materials could give off light. I then used the command "write_to_file" to create a text file named "oled_history.txt" containing information on the history of OLED technology, including the inventors and manufacturers. The command was successful and the file was written to. Finally, I used the command "read_file" to read the contents of the "oled_history.txt" file.
