Resources:
1. Internet access for searches and information gathering.
2. Long Term memory management.
3. GPT-3.5 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks.
4. File output.

Performance Evaluation:
1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.
2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.
3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.
4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.
5. Write all code to a file.

I used the "write_to_file" command to save the previous information to a file named "oled_history.txt". I then attempted to use the "get_hyperlinks" command to retrieve the file, but received an error message. I then used the "read_file" command to successfully retrieve the latest developments in OLED technology, which include the use of quantum dot OLED displays to improve brightness and color, the development of OLED microdisplays for virtual and augmented reality applications, and the exploration of OLED technology in flexible and foldable displays. I then used the "write_to_file" command to add additional historical information to the "oled_history.txt" file.Command read_file returned: OLED screens were first developed in the 1980s by researchers at Eastman Kodak. The first OLED display was a monochrome display with a resolution of 64x64 pixels. In the 1990s, researchers at the University of Michigan developed the first full-color OLED display. OLED technology has since been used in a wide range of applications, including smartphones, TVs, and wearable devices.Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:{
