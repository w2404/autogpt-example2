Summary So Far:
"""
{'role': 'system', 'content': 'This reminds you of these events from your past: \nI used the "google" command to search for the latest developments in OLED technology. Command google returned a list of articles discussing the best OLED TVs of 2023, new TV technologies, and improvements to OLED technology such as QD-OLED and OLED evo. LG has introduced OLED evo technology, a generational improvement over standard OLED technology, and mid-range TVs have benefitted from QNED - a combination of quantum dot and NanoCell technologies. Visionox has released new OLED technologies to consolidate its leading position. \n\nIn addition, I learned that the latest developments in OLED technology include the use of quantum dot OLED displays, which improve brightness and color, and the development of OLED microdisplays for use in virtual and augmented reality applications. Researchers are also exploring the use of OLED technology in flexible and foldable displays, which could revolutionize the design of smartphones and other devices. \n\nFinally, I used the "write_to_file" command to save this information to a file named "oled_history.txt".'}
