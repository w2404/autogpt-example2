The first OLED display was a monochrome display with a resolution of 64x64 pixels. In the 1990s, researchers at the University of Michigan developed the first full-color OLED display. OLED technology has since been used in a wide range of applications, including smartphones, TVs, and wearable devices.'}, {'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"recent advancements in OLED technology\"}}}'}]\n\"\"\"\n"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "openai_log": false}
