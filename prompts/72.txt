Discussed at first are the fundamentals of OLED optics and how the refractive indices of different layers in an OLED stack affect the extraction efficiency.\\n- Ph-OLED is a next-generation most efficient display and lighting device that overcomes the limitation of efficiency (25%) in fluorescence OLED. We can get better internal quantum efficiency due to the participation of both singlet and triplet state transitions.\\n- In a groundbreaking new study, researchers at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities used a customized printer to fully 3D print a flexible organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display.\\n- QD-OLED panels on both TVs and gaming monitors are made by Samsung Display and differ from those manufactured by LG."}}}'}, {'role': 'your computer', 'content': 'Command write_to_file returned: File written to successfully.'}, {'role': 'you', 'content': '{"command": {"name": "append_to_file", "args": {"filename": "oled_advancements.txt", "text": "\\n\\nHistory of OLED screens:\\n- OLED technology was first developed in the 1980s by researchers at Eastman Kodak.\\n- The first OLED display was created in 1987 by Ching W.
