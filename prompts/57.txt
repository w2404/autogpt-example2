I used the "google" command to search for information on the challenges and opportunities of OLED screens. The search returned several articles discussing the challenges of OLED technology, including its limitations in terms of lifetime, cost, and size scalability. One article also mentioned that the major challenge is still with the lifetime of blue phosphorescent OLEDs. However, OLEDs are being used for display, mobile devices, and TV, and the next major application for OLED technology is in AR and VR displays. The reports on OLED display market provide a holistic analysis, market size and forecast, trends, growth drivers, and challenges, as well as vendor analysis covering around 25 vendors.Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:{

    }
}Command read_file returned: OLED screens were first developed in the 1980s by researchers at Eastman Kodak. The first OLED display was a monochrome display with a resolution of 64x64 pixels. In the 1990s, researchers at the University of Michigan developed the first full-color OLED display. OLED technology has since been used in a wide range of applications, including smartphones, TVs, and wearable devices.Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:
