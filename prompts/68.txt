Your task is to create a concise running summary of actions and information results in the provided text, focusing on key and potentially important information to remember.

You will receive the current summary and the your latest actions. Combine them, adding relevant key information from the latest development in 1st person past tense and keeping the summary concise.

Summary So Far:
"""
{'role': 'system', 'content': 'This reminds you of these events from your past: \nI previously used the command "google" with the argument "major milestones in the development of OLED technology" and my computer returned a message saying that the text was appended successfully to the "oled_challenges.txt" file. Now, my computer returned a list of search results for my query, including an overview of milestones in OLED technology, the three generations of emitter materials, and the fourth generation of OLEDs in progress. The search also included the history of emitter development and industry\'s interest in OLED technology, the potential usage of OLEDs in the lighting and display industry, and the major milestone reached in OLED development with a new flexible prototype. I then used the command "read_file" with the argument "filename": "oled_challenges.txt" to read the appended text. Command read_file returned: OLED screens face several challenges, including limited lifespan, high production costs, limited brightness, scalability, and color gamut. However, OLED screens also offer several opportunities, including thin and flexible form factors, high contrast ratios, deep blacks, low power consumption, and potential for new applications. OLED technology was first developed in the 1980s by researchers at Eastman Kodak and has since been used in a wide range of applications. I used the command "google" with the argument "recent advancements in OLED technology".'}
