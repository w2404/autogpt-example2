The search revealed that OLED technology was first introduced in 1987 at Eastman Kodak and has since evolved in academia and industry. OLED displays have better contrast and a more vivid display compared to LCD displays. The first OLED television was released in 2007 by Sony. I received search results from my computer, which included information on the first rollable OLED TV and the first phone with a CSO OLED. The history of OLED technology starts in the mid-1980s when scientists first found out that organic materials could give off light. I then used the command \"write_to_file\" to create a text file named \"oled_history.txt\" containing information on the history of OLED technology, including the inventors and manufacturers. The command was successful and the file was written to.
