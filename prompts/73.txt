Resources:
1. Internet access for searches and information gathering.
2. Long Term memory management.
3. GPT-3.5 powered Agents for delegation of simple tasks.
4. File output.

Performance Evaluation:
1. Continuously review and analyze your actions to ensure you are performing to the best of your abilities.
2. Constructively self-criticize your big-picture behavior constantly.
3. Reflect on past decisions and strategies to refine your approach.
4. Every command has a cost, so be smart and efficient. Aim to complete tasks in the least number of steps.
5. Write all code to a file.

You should only respond in JSON format as described below

I used the command "google" with the argument "recent advancements in OLED technology" and my computer returned a list of search results. I then used the command "write_to_file" to create a file named "oled_advancements.txt" and wrote a summary of recent advancements in OLED technology, including 3D-printed flexible OLED displays, QD-OLED panels, and the world's brightest OLED microdisplay. The command returned "File written to successfully." I then used the command "append_to_file" to add a history of OLED screens to the same file, including the first OLED display created in 1987 and the world's first rollable OLED television announced by LG in 2021. The command returned "File written to successfully."Command append_to_file returned: Text appended successfully.Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:{
