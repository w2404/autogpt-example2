The search returned several articles discussing the challenges of OLED technology, including its limitations in terms of lifetime, cost, and size scalability. One article also mentioned that the major challenge is still with the lifetime of blue phosphorescent OLEDs. However, OLEDs are being used for display, mobile devices, and TV, and the next major application for OLED technology is in AR and VR displays.
