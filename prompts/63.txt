}Command read_file returned: OLED screens face several challenges, including:
- Limited lifespan due to the degradation of organic materials
- High production costs compared to LCD screens
- Limited brightness compared to LCD screens
- Limited scalability for large displays
- Limited color gamut compared to other display technologies

However, OLED screens also offer several opportunities, including:
- Thin and flexible form factors for use in wearable devices and other applications
- High contrast ratios and deep blacks for improved image quality
- Low power consumption for improved battery life in portable devices
- Potential for new applications in areas such as automotive displays and lighting

Historical information on OLED technology:
OLED screens were first developed in the 1980s by researchers at Eastman Kodak. The first OLED display was a monochrome display with a resolution of 64x64 pixels. In the 1990s, researchers at the University of Michigan developed the first full-color OLED display. OLED technology has since been used in a wide range of applications, including smartphones, TVs, and wearable devices.Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:
