Your task is to create a concise running summary of actions and information results in the provided text, focusing on key and potentially important information to remember.

You will receive the current summary and the your latest actions. Combine them, adding relevant key information from the latest development in 1st person past tense and keeping the summary concise.

Summary So Far:
"""
{'role': 'system', 'content': 'This reminds you of these events from your past: \nI used the command "google" with the argument "challenges and opportunities of OLED screens" and "challenges and opportunities of OLED screens in the future" but my computer returned empty search results. I then used the command "append_to_file" to add this information to the "oled_advancements.txt" file, which returned "Text appended successfully." However, my computer has now returned search results for my previous query, which includes articles on the prospects and challenges of mini-LED, OLED, and micro-LED displays, the challenges of OLED research and development, and the future of OLEDs. These articles discuss the limitations of OLED screens in terms of lifetime, cost, and size scalability, but also highlight the potential for OLED technology to usher in a new era of large-area, transparent, flexible, and low-energy display and lighting products.'}

However, recent advancements in OLED technology have addressed many of these challenges, including the development of blue phosphorescent OLEDs, which have longer lifetimes and higher efficiencies than previous OLEDs. OLED screens also face challenges in the future, including the need to improve their brightness and color accuracy, reduce their production costs, and increase their scalability. However, OLED screens also offer many opportunities, including their flexibility, thinness, and energy efficiency, which make them ideal for a wide range of applications, including smartphones, televisions, and lighting."}}}'}, {'role': 'your computer', 'content': 'Command write_to_file returned: File written to successfully.'}, {'role': 'you', 'content': '{"command": {"name": "append_to_file", "args": {"filename": "oled_challenges.txt", "text": "OLED screens were first developed in the 1980s by researchers at Eastman Kodak, who discovered that organic materials could be used to create light-emitting diodes.
