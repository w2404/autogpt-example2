Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loadsThe current time and date is Sat May 13 14:50:45 2023This reminds you of these events from your past: 
I previously used the command "google" with the argument "major milestones in the development of OLED technology" and my computer returned a message saying that the text was appended successfully to the "oled_challenges.txt" file. Now, my computer returned a list of search results for my query, including an overview of milestones in OLED technology, the three generations of emitter materials, and the fourth generation of OLEDs in progress. The search also included the history of emitter development and industry's interest in OLED technology, the potential usage of OLEDs in the lighting and display industry, and the major milestone reached in OLED development with a new flexible prototype. I then used the command "read_file" with the argument "filename": "oled_challenges.txt" to read the appended text.Command read_file returned: OLED screens face several challenges, including:
- Limited lifespan due to the degradation of organic materials
- High production costs compared to LCD screens
- Limited brightness compared to LCD screens
- Limited scalability for large displays
- Limited color gamut compared to other display technologies

However, OLED screens also offer several opportunities, including:
- Thin and flexible form factors for use in wearable devices and other applications
- High contrast ratios and deep blacks for improved image quality
- Low power consumption for improved battery life in portable devices
- Potential for new applications in areas such as automotive displays and lighting

Historical information on OLED technology:
OLED screens were first developed in the 1980s by researchers at Eastman Kodak. The first OLED display was a monochrome display with a resolution of 64x64 pixels. In the 1990s, researchers at the University of Michigan developed the first full-color OLED display. OLED technology has since been used in a wide range of applications, including smartphones, TVs, and wearable devices.Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:{
