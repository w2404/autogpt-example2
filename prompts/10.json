Then, I used the command \"google\" to search for the history of OLED screens. The search revealed that OLED technology was first introduced in 1987 at Eastman Kodak and has since evolved in academia and industry. OLED displays have better contrast and a more vivid display compared to LCD displays. The first OLED television was released in 2007 by Sony.
