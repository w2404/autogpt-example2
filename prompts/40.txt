Your task is to create a concise running summary of actions and information results in the provided text, focusing on key and potentially important information to remember.

You will receive the current summary and the your latest actions. Combine them, adding relevant key information from the latest development in 1st person past tense and keeping the summary concise.

Summary So Far:
"""
{'role': 'system', 'content': 'This reminds you of these events from your past: \nI used the "google" command to search for the history of OLED screens. OLED technology has been evolving since the 1960s, with the development of full-color displays, improved efficiency, and longer lifespans. I added this information to the "oled_trends.txt" file using the "write_to_file" command. The latest development shows that OLED diode technology was invented by researchers at the Eastman Kodak company in 1987. OLED devices have come forward based on three generations of emitter materials relying on fluorescence (first generation), phosphorescence (second generation), and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (third generation). Furthermore, research in academia and industry toward the fourth generation of OLEDs is in progress. OLED displays have deeper blacks, better contrast, and a more vivid display.'}

In 1987, researchers at Eastman Kodak built the first OLED device that operated at sufficiently low voltages, marking a breakthrough in OLED technology.

While OLED screens have improved significantly in this regard, they still have a limited lifespan and can suffer from burn-in and other issues. Another challenge is the high cost of manufacturing OLED screens, which has limited their adoption in some industries. However, OLED screens also offer significant opportunities, such as their flexibility and ability to be used in curved and foldable displays. OLED screens also offer superior image quality, with deeper blacks, better contrast, and a wider color gamut than other display technologies."}}}'}]
