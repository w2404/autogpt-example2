The information I added earlier was about the evolution of OLED technology since the 1960s, with the latest development being the invention of OLED diode technology by researchers at the Eastman Kodak company in 1987. There have been three generations of emitter materials relying on fluorescence, phosphorescence, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence, with research in academia and industry toward the fourth generation of OLEDs in progress. OLED displays have deeper blacks, better contrast, and a more vivid display. Additionally, I used the \"append_to_file\" command to add information about the challenges and opportunities of OLED screens, including their relatively short lifespan, high cost of manufacturing, and superior image quality. Nothing new has happened since then.'}\n\"\"\"\n\nLatest Development:\n\"\"\"\n[{'role': 'your computer', 'content': 'Command append_to_file returned: Text appended successfully.'}, {'role': 'you', 'content': '{\"command\": {\"name\": \"google\", \"args\": {\"query\": \"latest developments in OLED technology\"}}}'}]\n\"\"\"\n"}], "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "openai_log": false}
