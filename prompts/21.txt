I used the command "google" to search for the challenges and opportunities of OLED screens. The search results showed that OLED technology faces challenges such as high production costs and limited lifespan, but also presents opportunities in areas such as flexible displays and energy efficiency. My computer returned a list of articles discussing the prospects and challenges of mini-LED, OLED, and micro-LED displays, as well as the challenges in OLED research and development. The articles also mentioned the advantages of OLEDs, such as saturated colors, ultra-fast switching, and lower power consumption than equivalent AMLCDs. The global OLED displays market is estimated to be valued at US$ 26.4 million in 2021 and is expected to exhibit a CAGR of 10.4 % over the forecast period (2021-2028).Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:{

However, it was not until the 1980s that the first practical OLED devices were developed. These early devices were monochromatic and had limited efficiency and lifespan. Over the years, OLED technology has continued to evolve, with the development of full-color displays, improved efficiency, and longer lifespans. Today, OLED screens are used in a wide range of applications, including smartphones, televisions, and wearable devices."
