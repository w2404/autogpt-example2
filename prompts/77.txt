I used the command "google" with the argument "challenges and opportunities of OLED screens" and "challenges and opportunities of OLED screens in the future" but my computer returned empty search results. I then used the command "append_to_file" to add this information to the "oled_advancements.txt" file, which returned "Text appended successfully." However, my computer has now returned search results for my previous query, which includes articles on the prospects and challenges of mini-LED, OLED, and micro-LED displays, the challenges of OLED research and development, and the future of OLEDs. These articles discuss the limitations of OLED screens in terms of lifetime, cost, and size scalability, but also highlight the potential for OLED technology to usher in a new era of large-area, transparent, flexible, and low-energy display and lighting products.Determine which next command to use, and respond using the format specified above:{
